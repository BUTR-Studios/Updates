# To-Do list for Butterium development 📒

- [x] Add a "support us" widget

- [ ] ButterHost integration and features
> ↳ Like controlling the server and starting a free trial from in game *(referral systems too)*, hook in with the social features

- [ ] Installer, launcher and minimal mobile app
> ↳ https://github.com/BUTR-Studios/BUTR-Launcher

- [ ] Launcher Crash Assistant
> ↳ With Discord link and "copy logs" button

- [ ] Redesign HUD editor w/ support for resizable HUD widgets
> ↳ With sliders and submenus

- [ ] Optional translucent HUD widget backgrounds

- [ ] Set up Discord Status to include download button

- [ ] For cool events servers, show live events on a main menu widget

- [x] Move assets to resources
> ↳ Also allow resource pack to edit configs and stuff with txts like overrides (prompt first)

>    Rework all icons as pixel-perfect images (maybe with seperate folder for included shadows)

>    Move all text to localization keys

- [ ] Spec detection and optimization 
> ↳ https://github.com/BUTR-Studios/spec-engine

>    Hardware scoring system, then finds optimal configs and modset for your specs

- [ ] Screenshot previews and viewer

- [ ] Elimination counter
> ↳ Maybe similar to Fortnite- skull icon?

- [ ] Custom HUD item counters

- [x] Armor and tool durability notifications

- [ ] Ports to 1.21.1 and 1.20.1 Fabric, maybe NeoForge one day

- [ ] Allow compatible mods to be installed and toggled from in-game
> ↳ "You have unsaved changes" text for when the user needs to restart their game

>    Remove mods with .bat/.sh

>    Inspired by Lunar and Feather mods screens- showing just icons, clicking them opens the description and/or config (maybe a description screen with a button for config)

- [ ] Update and enable friends sidebar
> ↳ With world/server invites, friends sidebar and social features are currently half-finished

- [ ] Click FX at the cursor
> ↳ Cool, customizable effect that follows accent colour

- [ ] Donate, help and Discord buttons somewhere in options

- [ ] Fix variable names and values + simplify and optimize all layouts and element anchors
> ↳ This will help users better understand Butterium and edit the FM configuration

- [ ] Known mod incompatibility warning from GitHub (ver).txt
> ↳ Compare loaded mods to a GitHub list of incompatible mods - also print to logs

>    Possibly also "compatibility mode"

- [ ] Custom inventory shortcuts
> ↳ Should be styled like the inventory and also adapt to resource packs, maybe contact some RP creators to add support

- [x] Remove some layouts for settings menus
> ↳ Would improve mod compatability with mods that change settings

- [ ] Send specs to API on command using MC username for help support
> ↳ Optionally also logs but we must ask for the users explicit permission and warn them of what logs store before doing anything

- [ ] Advanced customisation button in personalisation and Credits menus that leads to new menu
> ↳ This menu should teach users how to create and download resource packs for Butterium

- [ ] Custom backgrounds replacing "0" in the BG carousel (.png, .jpg, .jpeg)

- [ ] Light and Midnight UI themes
> ↳ credit: fishandchips

- [x] Use the accent colour in more places and improve UI design

- [ ] Tools for resource pack creators
> ↳ W/ FMv3.8 - imagine making a resource pack just by walking around your world and clicking blocks to change their texture by selecting a png from your system. This will update the pack you're working on in real time but won't **replace** messing with files

- [ ] Toggleable health indicators
> ↳ Could be done with a resource pack or mod
